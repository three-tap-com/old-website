## 📌 Project Overview

**Three‑Tap** began as a fully hand-coded platform—designed, developed, and deployed by me: data model, backend APIs, frontend UI, 3D visualizations, and AI chatbot. Recently, I rebuilt the platform using **Loveable AI** for improved scalability, polished UX, and faster development cycles.

This platform empowers JEE students to:  
- Explore historical admission data in interactive 3D dashboards  
- Get personalized college & branch predictions  
- Use AI-powered counseling chat for tailored guidance  

Ideal for students stuck in the decision-making stage—Three‑Tap turns historical data into actionable, user-friendly insights.
